# Optimal-Charging-Strategy-Li-ion-Battery
Solving for the Optimal Charging Strategy for a Li-ion Battery. This study is a collaborative effort by Peter Fazekas, Connor Mattinson and myself. This study is a group project for the course MA4J5 : Structures of Complex Systems run by Prof. Markus Kirklionis at Warwick University. 

We introduce the reaction kinetics within a standard Li-ion battery and determine an optimal charging strategy based on the standard CC-CV charging protocol. The result is a strategy which is can be interpreted as a double application of the CC-CV protocol. It is a curious observation that although we optimise for battery degradation, the resulting charging strategy offers at least a 10 minute speed up on charging time. Note all these results are theoretical and require further experimental validation
